## Allowlists

### Community allowlist : private sale access

All token owners from previous Bufalo collections are admissible on the "Community" allowlist, to mint up to two tokens during the private sale. See the list of eligible collections [here](./data/inputs/previous-collections/index.js).

### Fans allowlist : discount on the second mint

Those who supported Bufalo up to $50 are on the "Fans" allowlist, and get a 50% discount on the second token. Amounts are computed on USD-basis (rate at the time of sale), from :

- Decentraland purchases
- [Bufalo NFT realeases'](https://opensea.io/collection/bufalonftreleases) transactions on Opensea (Ethereum & Polygon). See the list of eligible tokens [here](./data/inputs/previous-collections/opensea-nftreleases.js).

## Tech Stack

**Interfaces** : Decentraland NFT API (DCL sales), NFTPort API (NFT data), Alchemy (Blockchain data), Coingecko (Prices history)

**Snapshot script, tests :** Node v18

**Smart contract language:** Solidity

**Smart contract framework:** Hardhat

**Smart contract libs and tools:** OpenZeppelin, Thirdweb, Chainlink

## Roadmap

‚úÖ Generate allowlists (addresses arrays & merkle data), from token ownerships and sales

üî≤ NFT metadata (skull images) & uploads on IPFS

üî≤ ERC721A contract for skull NFTs

### Smart contracts deployment

You can use [Thirdweb](https://portal.thirdweb.com/release) to deploy contracts

```bash
  npx thirdweb release
```

### Tests

```shell
npm run test # with gas reports according hardhat.config.js
```

To ensure that any Solidity function is tested, run the `coverage` script :

```shell
npm run coverage
```

### Security

/!\ Contracts are not audited yet.

Slither runs a suite of vulnerability detectors, prints visual information about contract details.

1. Install Slither

```shell
pip3 install slither-analyzer
```

See alternatives to install Slither on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/crytic/slither)

2. Run Slither

```shell
npm run analyze
```
