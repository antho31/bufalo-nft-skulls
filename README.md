## Allowlists

### Community allowlist : private sale access

All token owners from previous Bufalo collections are admissible on the "Community" allowlist. See the list of eligible collections [here](./data/inputs/previous-collections/index.js).

### Fans allowlist : discount on the second mint

Those who supported Bufalo up to $50 are on the "Fans" allowlist, and get a 50% discount on the second token. Amounts are computed on USD-basis (rate at the time of sale), from :

- Decentraland purchases
- [Bufalo NFT realeases'](https://opensea.io/collection/bufalonftreleases) transactions on Opensea (Ethereum & Polygon). See the list of eligible tokens [here](./data/inputs/previous-collections/opensea-nftreleases.js).

### Generate the allowlists

```bash
npm run snapshot
```

Result files can be found inside the `data/results` folder

### Mint : get merkle proofs for a specific address

You can fetch `https://bufalo-api.anthonygourraud.workers.dev/merkleproofs/:addr` to get the merkle proofs for an address `addr`.

```js

API route is updated and deployed after generating allowlists. It can be deployed manually with `npm run deploy-api`

## Tech Stack

**API Deployment** : Cloudflare Workers

**Interfaces** : Decentraland NFT API (DCL sales), NFTPort API (NFT data), Alchemy (Blockchain data), Coingecko (Prices history)

**Snapshot script, tests :** Node v18

**Smart contract language:** Solidity

**Smart contract framework:** Hardhat

**Smart contract libs and tools:** OpenZeppelin, Thirdweb, Chainlink

## Roadmap

‚úÖ Generate allowlists (addresses arrays & merkle data), from token ownerships and sales

üî≤ NFT metadata (skull images) & uploads on IPFS

üî≤ ERC721A contract for skull NFTs

- ERC4907 rentable NFT token standard and ERC2981 royalties implementations
- Minting price configurable for any ERC20 and/or blockchain's native coin
- Discounts & private sale access with Merkle proof verification
- Hat, trench coat & skull wearable transfers on mint
- Reveal with random assignation using Chainlink

üî≤ ERC20 and staking contracts

- The longer you stake the skull NFT, the more ERC20 tokens you get. Get 80 BUFA every 6 hours in staking.

üî≤ ERC721A for music NFTs

- Can be purchased burning ERC20 tokens
- NFT holder get commercial rights to the related music

### Smart contracts deployment

You can use [Thirdweb](https://portal.thirdweb.com/release) to deploy contracts

```bash
  npx thirdweb release
```

### Tests

```shell
npm run test # with gas reports according hardhat.config.js
```

To ensure that any Solidity function is tested, run the `coverage` script :

```shell
npm run coverage
```

### Security

/!\ Contracts are not audited yet.

Slither runs a suite of vulnerability detectors, prints visual information about contract details.

1. Install Slither

```shell
pip3 install slither-analyzer
```

See alternatives to install Slither on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/crytic/slither)

2. Run Slither

```shell
npm run analyze
```
