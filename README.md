## Allowlists

### Community allowlist : private sale access

All token owners from previous Bufalo collections are admissible on the "Community" allowlist, to mint up to two tokens during the private sale. See the list of eligible collections [here](./data/inputs/previous-collections/index.js).

### Fans allowlist : discount on the second mint

Those who supported Bufalo up to $20 are on the "Fans" allowlist, and get a 50% discount on the second token. Amounts are computed on USD-basis (rate at the time of sale), from : 
* Decentraland purchases 
* [Bufalo NFT realeases'](https://opensea.io/collection/bufalonftreleases) transactions on Opensea (Ethereum & Polygon). See the list of eligible tokens [here](./data/inputs/previous-collections/opensea-nftreleases.js).

Run the `privateSaleScript` script : 

```bash
npm run privateSaleScript
```
