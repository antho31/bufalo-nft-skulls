## Allowlists

### Community allowlist : private sale access

All token owners from previous Bufalo collections are admissible on the "Community" allowlist. See the list of eligible collections [here](./data/inputs/previous-collections/index.js).

### Fans allowlist : discount on the second mint

Those who supported Bufalo up to $50 are on the "Fans" allowlist, and get a 50% discount on the second token. Amounts are computed on USD-basis (rate at the time of sale), from :

- Decentraland purchases
- [Bufalo NFT realeases'](https://opensea.io/collection/bufalonftreleases) transactions on Opensea (Ethereum & Polygon). See the list of eligible tokens [here](./data/inputs/previous-collections/opensea-nftreleases.js).

### Generated allowlists

This ([Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jFPqO3S3dCODnYy4J-3v0ztPCuOTN7Qsvka_N4w_-K8/edit?usp=sharing)) indicates which are the addresses on the allowlists.

| [Fan allowlist](./data/results/allowlists/fans.json)                | Array of addresses                                               |

| [Sales](./data/results/communityActivity/totalSales.csv)            | Paid transactions summary                                        |
| [Community merkle](./data/results/merkleAllowlists/community.json)  | Merkle root & proofs for each address on the Community allowlist |
| [Fan merkle](./data/results/merkleAllowlists/community.json)        | Merkle root & proofs for each address on the Fan allowlist       |

### Mint : get merkle proofs for a specific address

You can fetch `https://bufalo-api.anthonygourraud.workers.dev/merkleproofs/:addr` to get the merkle proofs for an address `addr`.

```js
// Result from https://bufalo-api.anthonygourraud.workers.dev/merkleproofs/0x64E8f7C2B4fd33f5E8470F3C6Df04974F90fc2cA
{
  "addr": "0x64e8f7c2b4fd33f5e8470f3c6df04974f90fc2ca",

  // is from Community allowlist
  "privateSaleMerkleProof": [
    "0x....",
    "0x....."
  ],

  // is not from Fans allowlist
  "discountMerkleProof": []
}
```

## Rarities & $BUFA rewards

Rarity score is computed following [Open Rarity](https://www.openrarity.dev/) standard.
All attributes are defined within the metadata JSON files for each token, available [here](./data/results/metadata/BOTV/tokens/). The rarer the attributes of the token, the more $BUFA tokens its owner can receive.

### Claim $BUFA : get merkle proofs for a specific `metadataIds`

You can fetch `https://bufalo-api.anthonygourraud.workers.dev/merkleproofs/rewards/:metadataIds` to get the merkle proofs for `metadataIds`, assigned to tokens after the reveal.

```js
// Result from https://bufalo-api.anthonygourraud.workers.dev/merkleproofs/rewards/1,45,999
{
      error: false,
      invalidIds: [],
      metadataIds: ["1", "45", "999"],
      rewardsPerDay: [400, 50, 75],
      rewardsProofs: [
        [
          "0x....",
          "0x....."
        ],
        [
          "0x....",
          "0x....."
        ],
        [
          "0x....",
          "0x....."
        ]
      ]
}
```
